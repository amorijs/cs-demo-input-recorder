# Demo Recorder

CS2 demo to video tool that automatically extracts gameplay sequences and overlays input visualization for enhanced analysis and content creation.

![ezgif-4536771f1fc70e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2436df1f-de4a-48f2-a990-e8b44e418403)

## IMPORTANT

This tool uses [HLAE](https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx) which is **VAC BANNABLE** if used in a vac secured server.

This tool uses [cs-demo-manager](https://cs-demo-manager.com/) + HLAE to record videos, which launches your game with the `-insecure` flag, which prevents you from joining any vac secured server after it launches your game. Of course, once the game closes and you relaunch the game normally, you can join a vac secured server.

That being said, only the "happy path" has been tested. We have not done extensive testing of "what if I do this" or "what if I do that". The happy path for reference:

- Make sure CS is closed, and faceit or any other anti-cheat is not running (we have not tested what happens when faceit AC is running)
- Let the tool run, it should automatically close your game when it's complete.
- If anything goes wrong while the tool is running just close your game and kill the tool process.

If you mess up (it's not complicated) **we are not responsible**, and while we may try to offer support in this situation, we are not obligated.

If you want to be extra safe, you can log into a "dummy" steam account when recording demos

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you need to install the following dependencies:

### Required Dependencies

1. **PostgreSQL + CS Demo Manager (CSDM)**

   - Download and install from: https://cs-demo-manager.com/docs/installation
   - CSDM handles demo parsing and initial video recording
   - Requires PostgreSQL database for demo analysis. This will be completed if you follow the steps in the link above.

2. **FFmpeg**
   - Download and install from: https://ffmpeg.org/
   - Used for video processing and overlay rendering
   - Make sure `ffmpeg` is available in your system PATH. This should be done automatically, but if not: [google it :)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+ffmpeg+to+path&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1091US1091&oq=how+to+add+ffmpeg&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCTU2NTNqMGoxNagCDLACAfEFXCvFSsvkR70&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

### Verification

The tool will automatically check for these dependencies when you run it. You should see:

```
üéÆ Demo Recorder Interactive Setup

Checking dependencies...

‚úÖ CS Demo Manager (csdm) - Found
‚úÖ FFmpeg - Found

üéâ All dependencies are installed!
```

## Installation and Usage

1. **Make sure you've read the [IMPORTANT](#IMPORTANT) section**

2.  **Download the latest build** from the [releases page](../../releases). Always scan `.exe` files you download
     
3. **Extract the file** to a folder of your choice. Recommended: create a new blank folder as the program will save files in the same location
  
4. **Make sure CS and faceit AC is closed**

5. **Run the program**: Double-click `cs_demo_input_recorder.exe` and follow the instructions you see in the command prompt (it should be self explanatory from here).
  
6. **Make sure CS closes after the process is complete**. This should be done automatically, but if not be sure to close it.

### Command Line Mode (Advanced users only)

For scripting or advanced usage (requires Bun or Deno):

```bash
bun run src/cli_base.ts -- --demoPath "path/to/demo.dem" --outputDir "output" --userId "76561198055776914"
```

## How It Works

1. **Demo Analysis**: Uses CSDM to analyze the demo file and extract player information
2. **Sequence Detection**: Automatically identifies gameplay sequences based on:
   - Player spawn events
   - Player death events
   - Round end events
   - Match end events
3. **Video Recording**: Records sequences using CSDM with:
   - Player-focused camera
   - Team voice communication
   - 60fps @ 1920x1080 resolution
4. **Input Overlay**: Extracts player input data and generates visual overlays showing:
   - Movement keys (WASD)
   - Action keys (Space, Ctrl, E, R, Shift)
   - Mouse buttons (M1, M2)
5. **Final Processing**: Concatenates all sequences into a single video file

## Output

The tool generates:

- Individual sequence videos (temporary)
- Overlay-enhanced versions of each sequence (temporary)
- Final concatenated video: `final.overlay_[timestamp].mp4`
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Overlay Visualization

The movement overlay displays a keyboard layout showing:

```
    W   E   R
SHIFT A S D   M1
 CTRL  SPACE  M2
```

- **Active keys** are highlighted in cyan
- **Inactive keys** are shown with subtle backgrounds
- **Real-time feedback** synced to player input

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"csdm command not found"**

- Ensure CS Demo Manager is properly installed and in your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal after installation

From the [csdm CLI page](https://cs-demo-manager.com/docs/cli):

If you have a message csdm not found, it means that the folder where the CLI executable csdm.exe is located is not in your PATH environment variable.
The default path is C:\Users\Username\AppData\Programs\CS Demo Manager and you can follow this guide to add it to your PATH variable.

**"ffmpeg command not found"**

- Install FFmpeg and ensure it's in your system PATH
- On Windows, you may need to add the FFmpeg bin directory to your PATH environment variable

**"Demo not found in database"**

- The tool automatically runs `csdm analyze` to import demos
- Large demos may take time to analyze on first run

**Fontconfig errors (Windows)**

- These are warnings from FFmpeg and don't affect functionality
- The errors don't impact video generation quality

### Performance Tips

- Use SSD storage for faster video processing
- Close unnecessary applications during processing
- Longer demos will take more time to process
- Consider processing only the last few sequences for quicker results

## Known Bugs

- **Jump detection issue**: Space (jump) isn't always registered correctly. Currently investigating if this is a CS2 demo parsing limitation or an issue with the input detection logic.
